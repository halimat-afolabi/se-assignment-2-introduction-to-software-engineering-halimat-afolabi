# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
    this is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the  development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
    software engineering integrates several programs to achieve a task

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
    THEY INCLUDE:
    Requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
    1. Requirements
    Gather and document what the software should do and any constraints.
    2. Design
    Plan the architecture and components of the software based on the requirements.
    3. Implementation
    Write and compile the code to create the software.
    4. Testing
    Verify the software works correctly and meets the requirements.
    5. Deployment
    Release the software to users and configure the environment.
    6. Maintenance
    Fix issues and update the software as needed to ensure ongoing performance and relevance.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:   
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

    The agile model uses the iterative and incremental approach and is focused on flexibilty, collaboration and responding to change. while in the waterfall model the tasks are completed sequentially (i.e. one step at a time)
    Waterfall model is good for short term task while agile method shold be used for long-term tasks.
Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
    Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software project. It involves gathering stakeholder needs, analyzing and specifying requirements, and managing changes. This process is crucial because it ensures that the final software product meets user needs and expectations, reducing the risk of costly revisions and project failures.
Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

    Modularity in software design refers to dividing a system into distinct, independent modules, each responsible for a specific functionality. This improves maintainability by making it easier to understand, debug, and update individual parts without affecting the whole system. It enhances scalability by allowing new features to be added as separate modules, minimizing the impact on existing components and simplifying expansion.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
    Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
    Integration Testing: Verifies that combined components or systems interact as expected.
    System Testing: Assesses the entire system's functionality and performance against requirements.
    Acceptance Testing: Confirms the system meets user needs and requirements for final approval.

    Testing is crucial in software development to identify and fix defects early, ensure reliability and performance, and validate that the software meets specified requirements and user expectations.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

    VCS are are tools for tracking changes to source codes and coordinating work among team members.
    eg: GIT, Subversion

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
